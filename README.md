## Project Overview

The Gobble Bot: Autonomous Food Delivery project is based upon the desire to provide the students on campus a hassle-free option to get food delivered from the dining facilities directly to their dorms for mobility limited students or those that desire the convenience. This will aid in less students in the dining facilities, crowding and overwhelming staff while also allowing for more economic opportunity by expanding the potential consumer base to the students who want food delivered.

We believe this project is feasible as we have created a prototype previously that demonstrated the conceptual practicality of our goals and similar implementations are found at other campuses such as GMU and JMU demonstrating that the technology is available and a demand for these services exists. Our approach should be competitive with these alternatives as we will be able to offer the service at a much lower price to the campus as we are our own labor, are not solely driven through profit motivation and are VT based which is attractive for our potential on campus investors.

Our endeavors are sustainable as well as we can quickly create more robots as demand requires due to our small scale manufacturing approach being easily expanded at scale by using simple materials and additive manufacturing that is easily reproducible. Furthermore, we can adapt our pathfinding to new dorm and dining construction as well by utilizing open source map data making it resilient for the foreseeable future. There is also a link between its desirability and sustainability as students desiring to have food delivered is not likely to change for the long term and therefore makes the project attractive in the long term.

We have proven that we were able to make a prototype using the technology available to upon a highly restricted budget which proves that we should be able to create a cheaper and therefore competitive alternative to the similar robotic delivery provided at other campuses.
